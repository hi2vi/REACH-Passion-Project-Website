        Welcome to my site!
        Did you know that my friend Vihaan also has a website for his Passion Project (check the <button onclick="goToLink('https://shauryacomputers.tech/personal.html');">About</button>)
        The link is <button onclick="goToLink('https://vishnukamasamudram.wixsite.com/moneycraft');">Moneycraft</button>

        So, you wanted to learn more about computers?
        Welp, you can't escape now!
        I will show you through a labyrinth of computers, programming, and I'll also have to relearn HTML form elements again.
        So are you ready? I don't care.
        Just come.

        Okay, so the first part of the computer, the obvious part is the display screen or monitor. The display/monitor is the part that
        you are viewing this on. The monitor is the display on a desktop, while the display is the screen on a laptop.

        The next part of the computer is the thing I'm typing this on. Can you guess what that is? Wrong, it's the keyboard.
        Don't pretend like you don't have one. How did you get to this website if you don't have a keyboard?

        Another part of the computer is called the base panel. It's a panel that contains the motherboard, the RAM, the cooling fan, hard drive, etc. 

        So now, let me ask you a few questions (time to learn forms).

        <form id="first-quiz">
            <label for='first-question'>What is a keyboard?</label><br>
            <input id="first-question"><br><br>
            <label for='second-question'>What is a computer?</label>
            <input id="second-question"><br><br>
            <label for='third-question'>What is a base panel?</label>
            <input id="third-question"><br><br>
        </form>

        <button onclick="submitForm()" id="submitbtn" style="visibility: visible;">Submit</button>
    </pre>
    <script>
        function checkInputEmpty() {
            let id1 = document.getElementById("first-question").value;
            let id2 = document.getElementById("second-question").value;
            let id3 = document.getElementById("third-question").value;

            if (id1 === '' || id2 === '' || id3 === '') {
                return false;
            }

            return true;
        }

        function submitForm() {
            if (checkInputEmpty()) {
                goToLink("https://shauryacomputers.tech/my-coding.html");
            } else {
                // Perform your desired action when the form is submitted and one or more inputs are empty
                alert("Please fill in all the fields!");
            }
        }

        // Call checkInputEmpty() function when the inputs lose focus
        document.getElementById("first-question").addEventListener("blur", checkInputEmpty);
        document.getElementById("second-question").addEventListener("blur", checkInputEmpty);
        document.getElementById("third-question").addEventListener("blur", checkInputEmpty);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
