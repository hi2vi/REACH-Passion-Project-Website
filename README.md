# My Reach Project

This website was made as a project for my 5th grade REACH class. I coded it myself, and it's all about computers, and how they work. There is also a page about myself, if you want to know more about me. For my projects, they should download to a zip. Then, extract the files. After you do that, open up the .exe inside those folders and voila! The program will run.
