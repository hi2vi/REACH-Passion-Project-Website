# My Reach Project

This website was made as a project for my 5th grade REACH class. I coded it myself, and it's all about computers, and how they work. There is also a page about myself, if you want to know more about me. It also has a download for all of the games that I have made. The projects all come in form of a .zip, and just open up the .exe that lies inside that folder. And then voila! The game will start when you open the .exe.
