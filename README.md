# My Reach Project

This website was made as a project for my 5th grade REACH class. I coded it myself, and it's all about computers, and how they work. There is also a page about myself, if you want to know more about me. I was planning for it to allow you to play the games I've made, but they are too in memory for the website to put on the website.
